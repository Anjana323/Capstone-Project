ASSESSING CREDIT RISK: PREDICTING NON-PERFORMING ASSETS USING REGRESSION ANALYSIS

                                                              ABSTRACT
This study examines the application of logistic regression to assess credit risk and predict loan defaults, 
using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle that contains 255,347 records, each representing a unique loan ID and corresponding borrower characteristics.
A logistic regression model was constructed using SPSS software. The predictor variables included Income, Loan Amount, Debt-To-Income Ratio, Credit Score, Has Dependents, 
Has Co-Signers, Education, Employment, Loan Purpose, Marital Status, Has Mortgage, Number of Credit lines, interest rate, months employed, and Loan Term. The target variable, default, is binary, taking values of 0 and 1. 
The odds ratios indicate that financial stability factors like income, DTI, and interest rate, along with borrower characteristics such as employment, co-signer, and credit score, are significant determinants of default risk. 
Although the model achieved a high overall classification accuracy of 88.4%, it demonstrated limited explanatory power and a sensitivity rate of only 0.8% in identifying actual defaulters.
These results highlight the model's bias towards the majority class and emphasize the necessity for class-balancing techniques and the inclusion of additional predictive variables to improve the robustness and practical applicability of credit risk prediction models in microfinance and lending institutions.
